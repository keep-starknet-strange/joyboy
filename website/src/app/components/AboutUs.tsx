            Welcome to Joyboy, the decentralized social media platform built
            with Nostr and powered by Starknet account abstraction. Joyboy aims
            to revolutionize social networking by blending SocialFi (social
            finance) with cutting-edge blockchain technology, bridging the gap
            between Web2 networks and decentralized finance (DeFi). This
            integration allows users to earn rewards for their engagement while
            maintaining control over their data and freedom of expression.

          <h1 className="text-5xl p-5">Why Nostr</h1>
          <p className="p-5 tracking-wide leading-loose">
            Nostr, short for "Notes and Other Stuff Transmitted by Relays," is a
            simple yet powerful protocol enabling secure and
            censorship-resistant communication. Here's a brief guide to
            understanding Nostr:
            <ol className="list-decimal p-4">
              <li>
                Decentralized Network: No central authority controls Nostr,
                ensuring true decentralization.
              </li>
              <li>
                Pseudonymous Accounts: No need for an email or phone number to
                create an account.
              </li>
              <li>
                Monetization: Creators can earn tips directly from their
                content.
              </li>
              <li>
                Open Source: Anyone can contribute to the development of Nostr.
              </li>

          <h1 className="text-5xl p-5">How does Nostr work ?</h1>
          <p className="p-5 tracking-wide leading-loose">
            Nostr operates by allowing users to publish and query notes through
            independent servers (relays), eliminating single points of failure
            and enhancing both privacy and reliability. This decentralized
            approach addresses the censorship issues faced by traditional social
            media platforms, offering a haven for controversial speech without
            the risk of deplatforming. Nostr's innovative approach to identity
            and user experience allows individuals to view feeds from any public
            key, offering diverse perspectives and a unique glimpse into other
            users' thoughts and

            What is Joyboy?
          </h1>
          <p className="p-5 tracking-wide leading-loose">
            Joyboy is a decentralized SocialFi platform that combines the Nostr
            protocol with Starknet's native account abstraction. Nostr, often
            referred to as the "Farcaster" of Bitcoin, emphasizes censorship
            resistance and is minimalistic and pure in design. Utilizing Bitcoin
            cryptographic primitives such as Schnorr signatures and concepts
            like NIP-13 Proof of Work as an anti-spam mechanism, Nostr is
            integrated into various Lightning wallets like @getAlby, Wallet of
            Satoshi and Blue wallet Leveraging the power of Starknet's Account
            Abstraction, Joyboy enables users to control their Starknet accounts
            with their Nostr keypair. This integration allows us to build
            advanced features like fully trustless Social Pay and intent-based
            actions driven by messages on the social app. We can even explore
            Al-driven intent-based systems with trustless on-chain verification
            using ZKML provided by Giza Tech and Herodotus
