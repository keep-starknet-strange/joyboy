# Introduction

**Joyboy is a Decentralized social built with Nostr and powered by Starknet account abstraction**.

## Origin story

The name "Joyboy" is inspired by the character from the manga series "One Piece". Joyboy is a mysterious figure from the Void Century who left behind a treasure called the "One Piece". What if the treasure are the friends we made along the way? A decentralized social network should be a treasure trove of memories and connections..

Also Joyboy refers to a figure in the Caribbean mythology, a dancing god with a constant smile.

Joyboy is considered as the personification of freedom and joy.

Yes! This is what social networks should be about. A place where you can be yourself, express your thoughts and feelings, and connect with others.

Freedom requires censorship resistance, and Nostr provides exactly that.
